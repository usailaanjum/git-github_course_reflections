// When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when you are looking to share your work with others or collaborate

// Why might you always want to pull changes manually rather than having git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To extract just what you need from other collaborators.

//Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork: copy a repo over the github servers
clones: copy a repo to your local machine
branches: branch out commits and work on features within a repo 

// What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
 This allows us to work remotely without internet access. 

// How would you collaborate without using Git or Github? What would be easier and what would be harder?
Harder: emails/ facebook messages
Easier: google drive 

// When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Using a different branch would allow you to experiment without risking messing up the master branch.
